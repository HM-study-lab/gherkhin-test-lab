## 🧪 Goals

- Learn the Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then)
- Practice writing feature files for user scenarios
- Automate tests using Python with the Behave framework
- Structure test projects for maintainability and clarity

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
